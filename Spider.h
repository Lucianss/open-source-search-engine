// Overview of Spider
//
// this new spider algorithm ensures that urls get spidered even if a host
// is dead. and even if the url was being spidered by a host that suddenly went
// dead.
//
// . Spider.h/.cpp contains all the code related to spider scheduling
// . Spiderdb holds the SpiderRecs which indicate the time to spider a url
// . there are 2 types of SpiderRecs: SpiderRequest and SpiderReply recs
//
//
// There are 3 main components to the spidering process:
// 1) spiderdb
// 2) the "waiting tree"
// 3) doledb
//
// spiderdb holds all the spiderrequests/spiderreplies sorted by 
// their IP
//
// the waiting tree holds at most one entry for an IP indicating that
// we should scan all the spiderrequests/spiderreplies for that IP in
// spiderdb, find the "best" one(s) and add it (them) to doledb.
//
// doledb holds the best spiderrequests from spiderdb sorted by
// "priority".  priorities range from 0 to 127, the highest priority.
// basically doledb holds the urls that are ready for spidering now.




// Spiderdb
//
// the spiderdb holds all the SpiderRequests and SpiderReplies, each of which
// are sorted by their "firstIP" and then by their 48-bit url hash, 
// "uh48". the parentDocId is also kept in the key to prevent collisions.
// Each group (shard) of hosts is responsible for spidering a fixed set of 
// IPs. 


// Dividing Workload by IP Address
//
// Each host is responsible for its own set of IP addresses. Each SpiderRequest
// contains an IP address called m_firstIP. It alone is responsible for adding
// SpiderRequests from this set of IPs to doledb.
// the doled out 
// SpiderRequests are added to doledb using Msg4. Once in doledb, a 
// SpiderRequest is ready to be spidered by any host in the group (shard), 
// provided that that host gets all the locks.



// "firstIP"
//
// when we lookup the ip address of the subdomain of an outlink for the first
// time we store that ip address into tagdb using the tag named "firstip".
// that way anytime we add outlinks from the same subdomain in the future they
// are guaranteed to get the same "firstip" even if the actual ip changed. this
// allows us to consistently throttle urls from the same subdomain, even if
// the subdomain gets a new ip. this also increaseses performance when looking
// up the "ips" of every outlink on a page because we are often just hitting
// tagdb, which is much faster than doing dns lookups, that might miss the 
// dns cache!


// Adding a SpiderRequest
//
// When a SpiderRequest is added to spiderdb in Rdb.cpp it calls
// SpiderColl::addSpiderRequest(). If our host is responsible for doling
// that firstIP, we check m_doledbIpTable to see if that IP address is
// already in doledb. if it is then we bail. Next we compute the url filter
// number of the url in order to compute its spider time, then we add
// it to the waiting tree. It will not get added to the waiting tree if
// the current entry in the waiting tree has an earlier spider time.
// then when the waiting tree is scanned it will read SpiderRequests from
// spiderdb for just that firstIP and add the best one to doledb when it is
// due to be spidered.


// Waiting Tree
//
// The waiting tree is a b-tree where the keys are a spiderTime/IPaddress tuple
// of the corresponding SpiderRequest. Think of its keys as requests to
// spider something from that IP address at the given time, spiderTime.
// The entries are sorted by spiderTime first then IP address. 
// It let's us know the earliest time we can spider a SpiderRequest 
// from an IP address. We have exactly one entry in the waiting tree from
// every IP address that is in Spiderdb. "m_waitingTable" maps an IP 
// address to its entry in the waiting tree. If an IP should not be spidered
// until the future then its spiderTime in the waiting tree will be in the
// future. 


// Adding a SpiderReply
//
// We intercept SpiderReplies being added to Spiderdb in Rdb.cpp as well by
// calling SpiderColl::addSpiderReply().  Then we get the firstIP
// from that and we look in spiderdb to find a replacement SpiderRequest
// to add to doledb. To make this part easy we just add the firstIP to the
// waiting tree with a spiderTime of 0. so when the waiting tree scan happens
// it will pick that up and look in spiderdb for the best SpiderRequest with
// that same firstIP that can be spidered now, and then it adds that to
// doledb. (To prevent from having to scan long spiderdb lists and speed 
// things up we might want to keep a little cache that maps a firstIP to 
// a few SpiderRequests ready to be spidered).



// Deleting Dups
//
// we now remove spiderdb rec duplicates in the spiderdb merge. we also call 
// getUrlFilterNum() on each spiderdb rec during the merge to see if it is
// filtered and not indexed, and if so, we delete it. we also delete all but
// the latest SpiderReply for a given uh48/url. And we remove redundant
// SpiderRequests like we used to do in addSpiderRequest(), which means that
// the merge op needs to keep a small little table to scan in order to
// compare all the SpiderRequests in the list for the same uh48. all of this
// deduping takes place on the final merged list which is then further
// filtered by this by calling Spiderdb.cpp::filterSpiderdbRecs(RdbList *list).
// because the list is just a random piece of spiderdb, boundary issues will
// cause some records to leak through, but with enough file merge operations
// they should eventually be zapped.


// DoleDB
//
// This holds SpiderRequests that are ready to be spidered right now. A host
// in our group (shard) will call getLocks() to get the locks for a 
// SpiderRequest in doledb that it wants to spider. it must receive grants 
// from every alive machine in the group in order to properly get the lock. 
// If it receives a rejection from one host it release the lock on all the 
// other hosts. It is kind of random to get a lock, similar to ethernet 
// collision detection.


//
// g_doledb
//
// Purpose: holds the spider request your group (shard) is supposed to spider 
// according to getGroupIdToSpider(). 96-bit keys, data is the spider rec with 
// key. ranked according to when things should be spidered.
// <~priority>             8bits
// <spiderTime>           32bits
// <urlHash48>            48bits (to avoid collisions)
// <reserved>              7bits (used 7 bits from urlhash48 to avoid collisio)
// <delBit>                1bit
// DATA:
// <spiderRec>             Xbits (spiderdb record to spider, includes key)
// everyone in group (shard) tries to spider this shit in order.
// you call SpiderLoop::getLocks(sr,hostId) to get the lock for it before
// you can spider it. everyone in the group (shard) gets the lock request. 
// if you do not get granted lock by all alive hosts in the group (shard) then
// you call Msg12::removeAllLocks(sr,hostId). nobody tries to spider
// a doledb spider rec if the lock is granted to someone else, just skip it.
// if a doling host goes dead, then its twins will dole for it after their
// SpiderColl::m_nextReloadTime is reached and they reset their cache and
// re-scan spiderdb. XmlDoc adds the negative key to RDB_DOLEDB so that
// should remove it from doledb when the spidering is complete, and when 
// Rdb.cpp receives a "fake" negative TITLEDB key it removes the doledbKey lock
// from m_lockTable. See XmlDoc.cpp "fake titledb key". 
// Furthermore, if Rdb.cpp receives a positive doledbKey
// it might update SpiderColl::m_nextKeys[priority] so that the next read of
// doledb starts there when SpiderLoop::spiderDoledUrls() calls
// msg5 to read doledb records from disk.
// TODO: when a host dies, consider speeding up the reload. might be 3 hrs!
// PROBLEM: what if a host dies with outstanding locks???


// SpiderLoop::m_lockTable (HashTableX(6,8))
// Purpose: allows a host to lock a doledb key for spidering. used by Msg12
// and SpiderLoop. a host must get the lock for all its alive twins in its
// group (shard) before it can spider the SpiderRequest, otherwise, it will 
// removeall the locks from the hosts that did grant it by calling
// Msg12::removeAllLocks(sr,hostId).


// GETTING A URL TO SPIDER
//
// To actually spider something, we do a read of doledb to get the next
// SpiderRequest. Because there are so many negative/positive key annihilations
// in doledb, we keep a "cursor key" for each spider priority in doledb.
// We get a "lock" on the url so no other hosts in our group (shard) can 
// spider it from doledb. We get the lock if all hosts in the shard 
// successfully grant it to us, otherwise, we inform all the hosts that
// we were unable to get the lock, so they can unlock it.
//
// SpiderLoop::spiderDoledUrls() will scan doledb for each collection that
// has spidering enabled, and get the SpiderRequests in doledb that are
// in need of spidering. The keys in doledb are sorted by highest spider
// priority first and then by the "spider time". If one spider priority is
// empty or only has spiderRequests in it that can be spidered in the future,
// then the next priority is read.
//
// any host in our group (shard) can spider a request in doledb, but they must 
// lock it by calling getLocks() first and all hosts in the group (shard) must
// grant them the lock for that url otherwise they remove all the locks and
// try again on another spiderRequest in doledb.
//
// Each group (shard) is responsible for spidering a set of IPs in spiderdb.
// and each host in the group (shard) has its own subset of those IPs for which
// it is responsible for adding to doledb. but any host in the group (shard)
// can spider any request/url in doledb provided they get the lock.


// evalIpLoop()
//
// The waiting tree is populated at startup by scanning spiderdb (see
// SpiderColl::evalIpLoop()), which might take a while to complete, 
// so it is running in the background while the gb server is up. it will
// log "10836674298 spiderdb bytes scanned for waiting tree re-population"
// periodically in the log as it tries to do a complete spiderdb scan 
// every 24 hours. It should not be necessary to scan spiderdb more than
// once, but it seems we are leaking ips somehow so we do the follow-up
// scans for now. (see populateWaitingTreeFromSpiderdb() in Spider.cpp)
// It will also perform a background scan if the admin changes the url
// filters table, which dictates that we recompute everything.
//
// evalIpLoop() will recompute the "url filter number" (matching row)
// in the url filters table for each url in each SpiderRequest it reads.
// it will ignore spider requests whose urls
// are "filtered" or "banned". otherwise they will have a spider priority >= 0.
// So it calls ::getUrlFilterNum() for each url it scans which is where
// most of the cpu it uses will probably be spent. It picks the best
// url to spider for each IP address. It only picks one per IP right now.
// If the best url has a scheduled spider time in the future, it will add it 
// to the waiting tree with that future timestamp. The waiting tree only
// stores one entry for each unique IP, so it tries to store
// the entry with the earliest computed scheduled spider time, but if 
// some times are all BEFORE the current time, it will resolve conflicts
// by preferring those with the highest priority. Tied spider priorities
// should be resolved by minimum hopCount probably. 
//
// If the spidertime of the URL is overdue then evalIpLoop() will NOT add
// it to waiting tree, but will add it to doledb directly to make it available
// for spidering immediately. It calls m_msg4.addMetaList() to add it to 
// doledb on all hosts in its group (shard). It uses s_ufnTree for keeping 
// track of the best urls to spider for a given IP/spiderPriority.
//
// evalIpLoop() can also be called with its m_nextKey/m_endKey limited
// to just scan the SpiderRequests for a specific IP address. It does
// this after adding a SpiderReply. addSpiderReply() calls addToWaitingTree()
// with the "0" time entry, and addToWaitingTree() calls 
// populateDoledbFromWaitingTree() which will see that "0" entry and call
// evalIpLoop(true) after setting m_nextKey/m_endKey for that IP.



// POPULATING DOLEB
//
// SpiderColl::populateDoledbFromWaitingTree() scans the waiting tree for
// entries whose spider time is due. so it gets the IP address and spider
// priority from the waiting tree. but then it calls evalIpLoop() 
// restricted to that IP (using m_nextKey,m_endKey) to get the best
// SpiderRequest from spiderdb for that IP to add to doledb for immediate 
// spidering. populateDoledbFromWaitingTree() is called a lot to try to
// keep doledb in sync with waiting tree. any time an entry in the waiting
// tree becomes available for spidering it should be called right away so
// as not to hold back the spiders. in general it should exit quickly because
// it calls getNextIpFromWaitingTree() which most of the time will return 0
// indicating there are no IPs in the waiting tree ready to be spidered.
// Which is why as we add SpiderRequests to doledb for an IP we also
// remove that IP from the waiting tree. This keeps this check fast.


// SUPPORTING MULTIPLE SPIDERS PER IP
//
// In order to allow multiple outstanding spiders per IP address, if, say,
// maxSpidersPerIp is > 1, we now promptly add the negative doledb key
// as soon as a lock is granted and we also add an entry to the waiting tree
// which will result in an addition to doledb of the next unlocked 
// SpiderRequest. This logic is mostly in Spider.cpp's Msg12::gotLockReply().
//
// Rdb.cpp will see that we added a "fakedb" record 

// A record is only removed from Doledb after the spider adds the negative
// doledb record in XmlDoc.cpp when it is done. XmlDoc.cpp also adds a
// "fake" negative titledb record to remove the lock on that url at the
// same time.
// 
// So, 1) we can allow for multiple doledb entries per IP and the assigned
// host can reply with "wait X ms" to honor the spiderIpWait constraint,
// or 2) we can delete the doledb entry after the lock is granted, and then
// we can immediately add a "currentTime + X ms" entry to the waiting tree to 
// add the next doledb record for this IP X ms from now.
//
// I kind of like the 2nd approach because then there is only one entry
// per IP in doledb. that is kind of nice. So maybe using the same
// logic that is used by Spider.cpp to release a lock, we can say,
// "hey, i got the lock, delete it from doledb"...



// The 128-bit Spiderdb record key128_t for a rec in Spiderdb is as follows:
//
// <32 bit firstIp>             (firstIp of the url to spider)
// <48 bit normalized url hash> (of the url to spider)
// <1  bit isRequest>           (a SpiderRequest or SpiderReply record?)
// <38 bit docid of parent>     (to avoid collisions!)
// <8  bit reserved>            (was "spiderLinks"/"forced"/"retryNum")
// <1  bit delbit>              (0 means this is a *negative* key)

// there are two types of SpiderRecs really, a "request" to spider a url
// and a "reply" or report on the attempted spidering of a url. in this way
// Spiderdb is a perfect log of desired and actual spider activity.

// . Spiderdb contains an m_rdb which has SpiderRecs/urls to be spidered
// . we split the SpiderRecs up w/ the hosts in our group (shard) by IP of the
//   url. 
// . once we've spidered a url it gets added with a negative spiderdb key
